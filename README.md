# Diabetes-Prediction-System
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using machine learning techniques.The dataset includes features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, insulin level. Using these features, a machine learning classifier learns patterns and predicts the risk of diabetes (Outcome: 0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes).
